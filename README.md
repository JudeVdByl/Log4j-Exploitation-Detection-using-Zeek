# Log4j-Exploitation-Detection-using-Zeek
This project demonstrates how I detected a Log4j exploitation attempt by analyzing network traffic using the Zeek network monitoring tool. I investigated multiple log files such as `log4shell.pcapng`, `signature.log`, `http.log`, and `log4j.log`, identifying key indicators of exploitation.
